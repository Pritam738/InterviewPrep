Q) Layers in Computer networks

imp: OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. 

It is a 7 layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform. All these 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one person to another across the globe.

Physical Layer
Data Link Layer
Network Layer
Transport Layer
Session Layer
Presentation Layer
Application Layer

Q) Processes and Threads

A process, in the simplest terms, is an executing program. One or more threads run in the context of the process. A thread is the basic unit to which the operating system allocates processor time. A thread can execute any part of the process code, including parts currently being executed by another thread.

Q) Difference between TELNET and FTP

They are connection oriented protocols as they create a connection between remote host and a server. AS name File Transfer Protocol, FTP is used for transferring the files from one system to another system. and TELNET is used for remote login for a system.

Q) FTP vs. HTTP

FTP uses two parallel TCPs to transfer files. The control connection is used to send information like passwords, and the data connection is used to send actual data.

The FTP server maintains state information like the user’s current directory for a particular session.

The client-side needs to authenticate itself in order to transfer information.

The server keeps track of a users’ state, which constrains the total number of sessions that FTP can maintain simultaneously.​


HTTP transfers control information in-band as it uses the same connection to transfer data as it does to control information.

HTTP is stateless. The server does not need to keep track of any user’s state.

The client may or may not authenticate themselves, i.e., client authentication is not mandatory.

Because HTTP is stateless, it can easily maintain multiple sessions simultaneously.

Q) What is a VPN?

A virtual private network (VPN), VPNs essentially create a data tunnel between your local network and an exit node in another location, which could be thousands of miles away, making it seem as if you’re in another place. This benefit allows online freedom, or the ability to access your favorite apps and websites while on the go.
